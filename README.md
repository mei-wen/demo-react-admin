### Installation ###

* Install dependencies
    ```Bash
    npm install
    ```

### Run the App ###
 
* Just run:
    ```Bash
    npm start
    ```
    
* The App will be running on localhost:3000
* Since the App requests APIs from _demo-node-api_, you need to run both of the projects to check out the full flow of this app.
* Or you can simply revise the state _isAuthenticated_ in _App.js_ to look inside.
